# PrinterToPDF
Project for converting captured printer data files to PDF format

Initially this conversion software is taken from the beta conversion application we are creating for the Retro-Printer module (http://www.retroprinter.com).  That project is (c) RWAP Software - www.rwapsoftware.co.uk

Whilst the module for capturing the printer data initially is not provided, this code is provided under the GNU General Public License, as it is felt that it would be of interest and benefit for those wanting to create software for converting Epson (ESC/P and ESC/P2) printer data files to PDF format.

It is hoped that support for PCL (and potentially ESC/POS) could also be added and this software would then provide a modern replacement for the old epsonps software - http://www.retroarchive.org/garbo/pc/source/epsonps.zip

At present it has basic ESC/P conversion functionality and will need some re-writing of the code to form a stand-alone module.
