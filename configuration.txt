PrinterToPDF v1.3

Configuration files are stored in /root/config/ as individual files

Currently the options are:

/root/config/linefeed_ending
This dictates the linefeed to be used in the captured data.
The setting is ignored when creating the PDF; but is used for the retained captured data file.
Set this to Unix (LF chr(10) only), Windows (CR + LF = chr(12) + chr(10) ) or Mac (CR chr(12) only)
Default is Windows

/root/config/output_path
Specify the path directory for storing the output from the PrinterConvertor
The resulting file is a copy of the original captured data; subject to changes required according to the retain_linefeed and linefeed_ending settings.
Default is /home/pi/data/

NB - The captured data is stored as XXXX.eps

These defaults can be altered by editing the above files, OR you can pass them as parameters to the call to the /printerConvertor
program.
