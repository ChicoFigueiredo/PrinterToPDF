PrinterToPDF v1.1

Configuration files are stored in /root/config/ as individual files

Currently the options are:

/root/config/emulation
Set this to Epson or HP to determine whether the PrinterConvertor should default to Epson ESC/P2 or HP PCL emulation.

Default is Epson

/root/config/linefeed_ending
This dictates the linefeed to be used in the captured data.
The setting is ignored when creating the PDF; but is used for the retained captured data file.
Set this to Unix (LF chr(10) only), Windows (CR + LF = chr(12) + chr(10) ) or Mac (CR chr(12) only)
Default is Windows

/root/config/output_path
Specify the path directory for storing the output from the PrinterConvertor
/usbstick will be recognised as a USB memory stick
The resulting file is a copy of the original captured data; subject to changes required according to the retain_linefeed and linefeed_ending settings.
Default is /home/pi/data/

NB - if emulation is set to Epson, the captured data is stored as XXXX.eps, if emulation is set to HP, captured data is stored as XXXX.pcl

These defaults can be altered by editing the above files, OR you can pass them as parameters to the call to the /printerConvertor
program.
